# Dashboard Controller Refactoring Summary

## What was accomplished:

### 1. **Extracted Complex Logic into Facade Objects**
- Created `Instruction::DashboardFacade` base class for presentation logic
- Created `Instruction::DashboardHabilitationsFacade` and `Instruction::DashboardDemandesFacade` concrete implementations
- Moved tab building, partial selection, and count logic from controller to facades
- Controller now only instantiates facades and passes them to views

### 2. **Separated Search Logic into Dedicated Objects**
- Created `Instruction::DashboardSearch` base class for all search-related logic
- Created `Instruction::DashboardHabilitationsSearch` and `Instruction::DashboardDemandesSearch` concrete implementations
- Search objects handle: ransack queries, sorting, pagination, result building
- Moved `search_terms_is_a_possible_id?` and `main_search_input_key` to search objects as class methods

### 3. **Improved Policy Integration**
- Refactored search objects to accept `scope:` parameter instead of `current_user:`
- Leverages controller's `policy_scope([:instruction, Model])` mechanism
- Removes policy instantiation from search objects, keeping them focused on search logic
- Follows Rails/Pundit conventions properly

### 4. **Updated View Integration**
- Modified `show.html.erb` to use `@facade` object instead of individual instance variables
- Partials still receive `search_engine` and `items` as locals from facade
- Maintains existing view structure while improving data flow

### 5. **Added Comprehensive Test Coverage**
- Created tests for all search objects (`spec/searches/instruction/`)
- Created tests for facade objects (`spec/facades/instruction/`)
- Tests verify both functionality and proper OOP structure
- Updated existing tests to use new scope-based approach

## Key Design Patterns Applied:

### **Single Responsibility Principle**
- Search objects: handle search logic only
- Facade objects: handle presentation logic only
- Controller: coordinate between objects and handle HTTP concerns

### **Template Method Pattern**
- Base classes define structure, concrete classes implement specific behavior
- `DashboardSearch` and `DashboardFacade` provide extension points

### **Dependency Inversion**
- Search objects depend on scope abstraction, not concrete policy implementations
- Facades depend on search object interface, not concrete search implementations

## What was learned:

### **Kent Beck's "Tidy First" Principles**
- Separated structural changes (extracting objects) from behavioral changes
- Maintained exact same functionality while improving code structure
- Each refactoring step was isolated and testable

### **Rails Best Practices**
- Controllers should be thin and focused on HTTP concerns
- Policy scoping should happen at controller level, not in service objects
- Search objects work well in `app/searches/` directory following Rails conventions

### **OOP Design Principles**
- Composition over inheritance: facades compose search objects rather than inheriting complex logic
- Clear interfaces: search objects expose clean public API (`search_engine`, `results`, `paginated_results`, `count`)
- Testable design: each object can be tested independently

## Next Steps / TODO:

### **CRITICAL: Run and Fix Tests**
- [ ] Run the existing test suite to ensure no regressions
- [ ] Fix any failing tests caused by the refactoring
- [ ] Verify integration tests still pass with new object structure
- [ ] Run feature tests to ensure UI functionality unchanged

### **Potential Improvements**
- [ ] Consider extracting tab building logic to separate object if it grows
- [ ] Evaluate if search objects could be reused in other controllers
- [ ] Consider adding caching layer to search results if performance becomes an issue

### **Code Quality**
- [ ] Run linter to ensure code style compliance
- [ ] Review for any remaining duplication between search objects
- [ ] Ensure all error handling is properly maintained

## Files Modified:
- `app/controllers/instruction/dashboard_controller.rb` - Simplified to use facades
- `app/facades/instruction/dashboard_facade.rb` - New base facade class
- `app/facades/instruction/dashboard_habilitations_facade.rb` - New concrete facade
- `app/facades/instruction/dashboard_demandes_facade.rb` - New concrete facade
- `app/searches/instruction/dashboard_search.rb` - New base search class
- `app/searches/instruction/dashboard_habilitations_search.rb` - New concrete search
- `app/searches/instruction/dashboard_demandes_search.rb` - New concrete search
- `app/views/instruction/dashboard/show.html.erb` - Updated to use facade
- `spec/searches/instruction/dashboard_search_spec.rb` - New tests
- `spec/searches/instruction/dashboard_habilitations_search_spec.rb` - New tests
- `spec/searches/instruction/dashboard_demandes_search_spec.rb` - New tests
- `spec/facades/instruction/dashboard_habilitations_facade_spec.rb` - New tests

## Key Takeaways:
1. **Refactoring should preserve behavior exactly** - users should see no difference
2. **Clean separation of concerns** makes code more maintainable and testable
3. **Following Rails conventions** makes the code more familiar to other developers
4. **Comprehensive testing** is essential when refactoring complex controller logic
5. **Policy scoping belongs in controllers**, not in service objects
